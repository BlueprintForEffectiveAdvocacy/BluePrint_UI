# Blueprint for Effective Advocacy

This app was the product of a 2-day civic hackathon at Code Switch 2017.

It's a platform for Civic Engagement and Community Organizing, allowing site visitors to select issues that matter to them, and then see what organizations work in that space, so they can email them from the app.

Visitors can also enter a home address and see a list of their local and federal representatives, along with contact info
